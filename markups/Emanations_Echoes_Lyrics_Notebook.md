### Lyrics
```
Steel in my lungs, dirt in my teeth,
Every dawn cuts deeper beneath.
No halo shines, no voices sing,
Just calloused truth and blistered skin.

I break the rock, I split the seed,
I feed the fire that feeds on me.
The hands of gods don't guide my way,
They built the world and walked away.

The weight don't lift, it makes me whole,
The drag, the ache, it shapes the soul.
Every scar's a prayer I've bled,
Every bruise, a word unsaid.

If heaven falls, it hits the ground,
And echoes here, where I am found.

Grindstone crown, rust and flame,
Work and will are the same.
I bear the weight that won't bow down,
The dust itself's my holy ground.

No comfort here, no promised peace,
Just sweat and breath that never cease.
The serpent coils beneath the wheel,
It hums the truth I came to feel.

I build my faith in iron tones,
In shattered nails and broken bones.
The spark I chase is underfoot,
Buried deep where roots take root.

If heaven falls, it hits the ground,
And echoes here, where I am found.

Grindstone crown, rust and flame,
Work and will are the same.
I bear the weight that won't bow down,
The dust itself's my holy ground.
```

### Lyrics
```
The forge cools down, the ash turns grey,
A heartbeat hums beneath the clay.
The sweat becomes a silver tide,
The night remembers what I hide.

Moon in the puddle, face undone,
Dreams drip slow from the workday's sun.
Hands still tremble, mind still burns,
Echoes twist as the daylight turns.

There's a rhythm crawling under skin,
A hunger soft, but edged within.
The dust I was begins to breathe,
And every breath pulls deep beneath.

In the dark, the body knows,
Where every buried river flows.

Mirrorbone, shadow vein,
Lust and memory, loss and gain.
The pulse that binds, the tide that calls,
Yesod rises when Malkhut falls.
```
